# DL-TomatoCrop-Scout
This project builds an efficient DL/CNN solution for smart farming. Taking Refernce from CNN network, constructing effective CNN model to treat Plant Village Dataset to classify tomato leaf diseases quickly and automatically. The method emphasizes basic criteria for effective deployment, promoting sustainable agriculture through focused treatment.

**Week 1** - Dataset Selection and Defining Problem Statement

During the first week of the internship, I selected the required dataset from the Kaggle website using the topic of sustainability.
The "Plant Village Dataset" was chosen as it contains images of plant leaf diseases. Based on this, an effective Deep Learning CNN model will be created and processed. 
Attached PlantVillageDataset in the github repository.
Dataset URL: https://github.com/gayathrip22/DL-TomatoCrop-Scout/tree/main/PlantVillageDataset

After selecting the relevant dataset, defined the problem statement.
