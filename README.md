# DL-TomatoCrop-Scout
This project builds an efficient DL/CNN solution for smart farming. Taking Refernce from CNN network, constructing effective CNN model to treat Plant Village Dataset to classify tomato leaf diseases quickly and automatically. The method emphasizes basic criteria for effective deployment, promoting sustainable agriculture through focused treatment.

**Week 1** - Dataset Selection and Defining Problem Statement
During the first week of the internship, I selected the required dataset from the Kaggle website using the topic of sustainability.
The "Plant Village Dataset" was chosen as it contains images of plant leaf diseases. Based on this, an effective Deep Learning CNN model will be created and processed. 
Attached PlantVillageDataset in the github repository.
Dataset URL: https://github.com/gayathrip22/DL-TomatoCrop-Scout/tree/main/PlantVillageDataset
After selecting the relevant dataset, defined the problem statement.

**Week 2** - Implementation of Main Source code, training and testing the model
During the Second week of the Internship, I have started the project by creating a folder named "PlantVillage100" by rounding off the number of images to 100 in every set of Tomato Leaf disease dataset which is originally obtained from Plant Village Dataset as already mentioned in week1. From the dataset called "PlantVillage100",this is been resized to the necessary conditions, which is needed to be trained and tested with the developed Deep Convolutional Neural Network Architecture and Proposed Model of Convolution Neural network with customized Layers. Finally after successful completion of Training and Testing of the dataset in the ratio of 80:20, we get the perfect Confusion matrix with required Parameters.
The GitHub Repository is fully attached with the Documents of Outputs such as Confusion Marix and Training Images.
